        A generic and adaptable interactive theorem prover
  </h1>

 <h2>Overview</h2>

<p class="body">
Tac is a framework for constructing and interacting with interactive
theorem provers for various logics.  It is designed to allow for easy
experimentation.  Tac is composed of several parts.
  <ul>
    <li>
      The primary component of Tac is a
      framework for implementing interactive theorem provers, and then interacting
      with said provers.  This core, called "tac", allows logicians to easily implement
      provers for logics of their choice, and then experiment with the provers.
      It allows for easy loading of different logics at runtime.  This part of
      the system acts a driver for reasoning with the logics.
    </li>
    <li>
      In addition to the core framework there are several logics implemented
      using tac.  These include a propositional logic and several first-order
      logics.  The first-order logics include classical and intuitionistic variants,
      and support universal, existential, and generic quantification, inductive
      and coinductive defintions via fixpoints, induction and coinduction, and
      automatic proof search based on focusing.
    </li>
    <li>
      Taci is a command line interface to the tac core.
    </li>
    <li>
      StickyTaci is a graphical user interface to Taci, written in C#.  It
      allows end-users to easily interact with the generated theorem provers,
      and provides such functionality as loading and saving of proofs, syntax
      highlighting, and automatic discovery of loaded logics and available
      tactics and tacticals.
    </li>
    <li>
      Stekki is another graphic user interface, for use where the CLR is
      unavailable; it is written in OCaml and uses Labltk.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
The distributed system comes with several example theorems.  They include
proofs of properties of peano arithmetic, standard list predicates, the
pi-calculus, buchi automata, and the simply typed lambda calculus.
</p>

<p>
The Tac system consists of two primary components: logics, which are OCaml modules
implementing a particular signature, and a driver program, which loads
logic modules and facilitates interaction with them.  Currently the most
interesting logics implemented using the system are a first-order classical
logic and a first-order intuitionist logic.  Both of these logics support
universal, existential, and generic quantification, inductie and coinductive
definitions via fixpoints, induction and coinduction, and automated proof
search based on focusing.

<h2>Current developers</h2>
<p>
Tac is an open source project.  The first major versions was
released on 18 June 2008. We welcome contributions from
others of both theorems and new features.  The developers
