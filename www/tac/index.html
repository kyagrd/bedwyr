   <h1 align=center>Tac:<br>
        A generic and adaptable interactive theorem prover
  </h1>

 <h2>Overview</h2>

 <p class="body">
 Tac is a framework for implementing interactive
 theorem provers with good support for both interactive proof development
 and automated proof search.
 While our main research focus is on <em>automated reasoning</em>,
 it is useful to be able to interactively play with the logic when
 developping automated tactics; moreover, an interactive system is often
 useful to manually fill the gaps between automatically discovered proofs.
 Currently, the main development within Tac is the logic &mu;LJ
 and its automated focused inductive theorem proving tactic.
 Tac provides several tools:
 </p>
 <ul>
   <li>
   <b>Taci</b> is a command line interface to the Tac core.
   </li>
   <li>
   <b>StickyTaci</b> is a graphical user interface to Taci, written in C#. It
   allows end-users to easily interact with the Tac-based theorem provers,
   and provides such functionality as loading and saving of proofs, syntax
   highlighting, and automatic discovery of loaded logics and available
   tactics and tacticals.
   </li>
   <li>
   <b>Stekki</b> is simpler graphic user interface, which should build
   on most UNIX-based systems;
   it is written in OCaml and uses Labltk.
   </li>
   <li>
   Tac produces proofs in an XML format. The tool <b>tactex</b>
   can be used to convert them to LaTeX, and allows some basic
   focusing-based proof <em>outlining</em>.
   </li>
 </ul>
 </p>

 <h2>More about Tac/&mu;LJ</h2>

 <p>
 The logic &mu;LJ is a simple but powerful extension of first-order
 logic with equality, least and greatest fixed points and minimal generic
 quantification. It enjoys a focusing proof system on which our
 implementation relies, for both automatic and interactive proof developments.
 </p>
 <p>
 Learn more about &mu;LJ in
 <a href="tac09.pdf"><em>Focused Inductive Theorem Proving</em></a>
 by Baelde, Miller, Snow &amp; Viel
 (submitted paper).
 </p>
 <p>
 The distributed system comes with several example theorems.  They include
 proofs of properties of Peano arithmetic, standard list predicates, the
 pi-calculus, Buchi automata, and the simply typed lambda calculus.
 </p>
 <p>
 Here is an illustrative list of the kinds of theorems for which the
 automated tactic <code>prove</code> can quickly find proofs:
 </p>
 <ul>
   <li>Commutativity and associativity of addition on natural numbers.
   </li>
   <li>Every natural number is either even or odd, the sum of two even numbers
   is even, <em>double</em> is the inverse of <em>half</em> for even numbers.
   </li>
   <li>Reflexivity, symmetry and transitivity of inductively defined
   equalities on lists and natural numbers.
   </li>
   <li>Reflexivity and transitivity of the ordering on natural numbers.
   </li>
   <li>Left and right neutrality of <em>nil</em> for list concatenation.
   </li>
   <li>Relationships between list reversal and length,
   list concatenation and length.
   </li>
   <li>Antisymmetry of the subtree ordering on binary trees.
   </li>
   <li>Reflexivity and transitivity of simulation.
   </li>
   <li>Totality of the Ackermann function:
   <code>pi x\ pi y\ nat x =&gt; nat y =&gt; sigma z\ ack x y z, nat z</code>.
   </li>
   <li>Totality of division by two:
   <code>pi x\ nat x =&gt; sigma h\ half x h</code>.
   </li>
   <li>Involution of list reversal:
   <code>pi x\ pi r\ reverse x r =&gt; reverse r x</code>.
   </li>
 </ul>

 <p>As said above, Tac produces proofs. Here are a couple examples.
 Most proofs are <em>outlined</em>: the asynchronous phase (invertible rules)
 is collapsed into one rule, leaving only the more relevant information
 in the proof. Even using this technique, we can only show here some of
 the simplest proofs automatically discovered. Larger proofs would be
 not only be unreadable, but in fact are not even manageable for LaTeX.
 Also, several of the Postcript files below are known to <b>not work in Ghostview</b>.
