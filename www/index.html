<h2><a name="description">Description</a></h2>

<p>
The SLIMMER project is currently focused on developing and
implementing formal frameworks for the specification of various kinds
of computational systems and for formally reasoning about properties
of these specifications.
Target specification languages are those that typically involve
high-levels of abstraction and symbolic computation.
When symbolic computations require bindings within linguistic
expressions, the <em>lambda-tree syntax</em> approach to
<em>higher-order abstract syntax</em> is used.
The project is also focusing on the relational style of specifications
that are commonly used to specify <em>structured operational
semantics</em> and <em>typing judgments.</em>
System building within this project have typically involved the
implication of <em>higher-order pattern unification</em> and of
backtracking proof search engines (as is found in, for example, 
<a href="http://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/Labo/Dale.Miller/lProlog/">&lambda;Prolog</a>).
</p>

<p>
One use of the systems that we are building is the mechanization of
metatheory and its use in reasoning about programming and
specification languages.  Such system may be useful in addressing the <a
href="http://alliance.seas.upenn.edu/~plclub/cgi-bin/poplmark/index.php?title=The_POPLmark_Challenge">POPLmark
Challenge</a>.  An approach to mechanizing metatheory that is related
to the perspective we take here can be found in the 2002 ACM ToCL
paper by McDowell and Miller (see reference <a
href="#publications">below</a>
and the following <a

<ul>
<li>
The <a href="http://abella.cs.umn.edu/">Abella</a> system was released
in February 2008. This is an interactive theorem prover for proving
properties of specifications written in the second-order hereditary
Harrop formula logic. The meta-reasoning is based on an extension of
the Alwen Tiu's LG-omega logic. The details of this extended logic are
available in a recently submitted
<a href="http://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/Labo/Dale.Miller/papers/def_nabla_draft.pdf">
paper</a>. Abella is written in OCaml by
Andrew Gacek and uses the higher-order pattern unification code of
Gopalan Nadathur and Natalie Linnell.
</li>

<li>
Version 1.1 of <a href="bedwyr">Bedwyr</a> was released in February
2007 (following the initial release of Version 1.0 in November 2006).
This open source system is hosted on INRIA's GForge system under the
<a href="http://gforge.inria.fr/scm/?group_id=367">Slimmer project</a>.
This OCaml system was developed by David Baelde and Andrew Gacek with
help from Axelle Ziegler and code for pattern unification code
extracted from the Teyjus system.  <a href="bedwyr">Read more</a>.
</li>

<li>
During the summer of 2007, the two graduate students David Baelde
(France) and Zachary Snow (USA), worked together to develop the Taci
system.  This system is intended as a flexible tactical style prover
in which a range of logics and proof systems could be specified and
explored.  A couple of user interfaces were also developed (one using
C# and the other Tk/Tcl).  While these system are intended for
``in-house'' prototyping, the code is available via <a
href="http://gforge.inria.fr/plugins/scmsvn/viewcvs.php/trunk/tac/?root=slimmer">svn</a>.
</li>

<!--
<li>
As part of his ongoing PhD work, Andrew Gacek (USA) is developing an
interactive theorem prover for proving properties of specifications
written in the higher-order hereditary Harrop formula logic. This
meta-reasoning system is based on the LG-omega logic by Alwen Tiu,
together with some theoretical extensions that are part of Andrew's
doctoral work. While the system is still under development, it is in
limited distribution within the research group and other interested
collaborators.
