    <p>
    The SLIMMER project has been focused on developing and
    implementing formal frameworks for the specification of various kinds
    of computational systems and for formally reasoning about properties
    of these specifications.
    Target specification languages are those that typically involve
    high-levels of abstraction and symbolic computation.
    When symbolic computations require bindings within linguistic
    expressions, the <em>lambda-tree syntax</em> approach to
    <em>higher-order abstract syntax</em> is used.
    The project is also focusing on the relational style of specifications
    that are commonly used to specify <em>structured operational
    semantics</em> and <em>typing judgments.</em>
    System building within this project have typically involved the
    implementation of <em>higher-order pattern unification</em> and of
    backtracking proof search engines (as is found in, for example, <a
    href="http://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/Labo/Dale.Miller/lProlog/">&lambda;Prolog</a>).
    </p>

    <p>
    One use of the systems that we are building is the mechanization of
    metatheory and its use in reasoning about programming and
    specification languages.  Such system have been used to address the <a
    href="http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~plclub/poplmark/">POPLmark
    Challenge</a>.  An approach to mechanizing metatheory that is related
    to the perspective we take here can be found in the 2002 ACM ToCL
    paper by McDowell and Miller (see reference <a
    href="#publications">below</a>
    and the following <a
    href="http://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/Labo/Dale.Miller/mcdowell/index.html">description</a>
    of that work).

    <p>The principle teams between the six years of funding for Slimmer
    (2005/2010) were the following two teams.</p>

      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
    Two other teams have been added in the final years of this project in
    order to help shape the next steps to take at the end of the funded
    period.

    <h2 id="funding">Funding</h2>

    <p class="body">
    Financial support for the project has been obtained from INRIA via its
    ``Equipes Associ&eacute;es'' program.  Matching funds have been
    contributed by the National Science Foundation (CISE Directorate and
    the Office of International Science and Engineering, Grant
    No. 0429572).  The opinions, findings, and conclusions or
    recommendations expressed in this material are those of the project

      <li>
      The <a href="http://abella-prover.org/">Abella</a> system was released
      in February 2008. This is an interactive theorem prover for proving
      properties of specifications written in the second-order hereditary
      Harrop formula logic. The meta-reasoning is based on an extension of
      the Alwen Tiu's LG-omega logic. The details of this extended logic are
      available in this <a
      href="http://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/Labo/Dale.Miller/papers/lfmtp08.pdf">paper</a>.
      Abella is written in OCaml by
      Andrew Gacek and uses the higher-order pattern unification code of
      Gopalan Nadathur and Natalie Linnell.
      </li>

      <li>
      Version 1.1 of <a href="bedwyr/">Bedwyr</a> was released in February
      2007 (following the initial release of Version 1.0 in November 2006).
      This open source system is hosted on INRIA's GForge system under the
      <a href="https://gforge.inria.fr/scm/?group_id=367">Slimmer project</a>.
      This OCaml system was developed by David Baelde and Andrew Gacek with
      help from Axelle Ziegler and code for pattern unification code
      extracted from the Teyjus system.  <a href="bedwyr/">Read more</a>.
      </li>

      <li>
      Version 0.9.2 of the <a href="tac/">Tac system</a> was released in January
      2010.  This open source system is hosted on INRIA's GForge system under the
      <a href="https://gforge.inria.fr/scm/?group_id=367">Slimmer project</a> as
      well.  This OCaml system was developed by David Baelde, Zach Snow, and

    <h2 id="publications">Publications</h2>

    <p>
    During the six years of its funding, Slimmer provided a context to two
    PhD thesis (Baelde and Gacek).  Several papers were co-authored by
    members of the associated teams and many other papers were published
    that contributed to the general thrust of the project.   A
    <a href="pubs.html">complete list of publications</a> from this
    project is available.
