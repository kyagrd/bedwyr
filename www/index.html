        The SLIMMER Project
      </h2>

      <p class="body">
      SLIMMER is a collaborative project between INRIA, France and the 
      University of Minnesota. This project concerns applications of proof
      search broadly construed&#8212;SLIMMER is an acronym for "Sophisticated 
      Logic Implementations for Modeling and MEchanical Reasoning."  The
      current focus of the research is on developing and implementing a
      formal framework for the specification of various kinds of
      computational systems and for formally reasoning about properties of
      these specifications. Target specification languages are those that
      typically involve high-levels of abstraction and symbolic
      computation. Recent work has illustrated that while logic can be used
      to both specify and reason about computation systems, specification
      and reasoning demand different support from underlying
      implementations. This project brings together researchers who are
      actively designing specification and reasoning systems as well as
      developing implementation of such logics.

        Funding
      </h2>

      <p class="body">
      Financial support for the project has been obtained from INRIA (for
      the French side) and the NSF (for the U.S. side). This funding is
      presently in the form of grants that support travel for the
      project personnel between the two sites. The support from INRIA is
      provided via its "Equipes Associ&eacute;es" program, with the
      recognition of SLIMMER as an Associated Teams project. The NSF support
      derives from the CISE Directorate and the Office of International
      Science and Engineering.

            Future Plans

          <p class="body">
          This project was initially designed to bring together the Parsifal and
          Teyjus teams with the objective of exploring the use of the modern day
          understanding of proof search in building sophisticated systems for
          modelling and reasoning about models. We hope to expand the present
          scope of this project both by diversifying its personnel pool and by
          expanding its resources. We invite interested potential partners and
          participants to contact Dale Miller or Gopalan Nadathur.
