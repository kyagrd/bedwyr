% Here we define an append predicate and prove properties about it such as
% coverage and determinancy. Bedwyr does not yet support induction, so we
% use the "list" predicate to isolate a finite domain to work over.
% Eventually, it would be nice to extend Bedwyr to handle the general case
% since coverage and determinancy checks would be useful to lambda prolog
% programmers, for example.

list nil.
list (cons X nil).
list (cons X (cons Y nil)).
list (cons X (cons Y (cons Z nil))).

append nil K K.
append (cons X L) K (cons X M) := append L K M.

% In the following checks, we assume the mode: append +L +K -M.

% Coverage implicitly proves termination
coverage := pi L\ pi K\ list L => sigma M\ append L K M.

determinancy := pi L\ pi K\ pi M\ pi Mp\
    list L => append L K M => append L K Mp => M = Mp.

test := (coverage ; print "Coverage failure"),
        (determinancy ; print "Determinancy failure"),
        print "Done".
