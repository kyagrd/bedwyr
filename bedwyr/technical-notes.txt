Some technical notes
====================
Alwen Tiu, 02 September 2011.

These notes are to give an overview of the modifications I made to a
branch of Bedwyr that I created in the process of implementing the
bisimulation checker SPEC.  This should be viewed as a temporary
documentation to facilitate the merging of this branch into the main
trunk of Bedwyr. It should be eventually integrated into the existing
documentation structure for the project.

I. Non-logical extensions

I have added the following non-logical predicates:

- _not : o -> o.
  This is the standard negation-as-failure as in prolog.

- _if: o -> o -> o -> o.
  If-Then-Else:
  (_if P Q R) is basically equivalent to (P /\ Q) \/ (not(P) /\ R).
  The slight difference is that the second disjunct will not be tried
  if P is successful.

- _distinct: o -> o.
  Calling (_distinct P) directs bedwyr to produce only distinct answer
  substitutions.

- _abstract: a -> ((b -> a) -> a) -> a -> o.
  (_abstract T Abs T') abstracts the logic variables in T of type b,
  and apply the constructor Abs to each abstraction, and unify the
  result with T'.

  Example query:
  ?= _abstract (pr X Y) abs T.
  Solution found:
  X = X
  Y = Y
  T = (abs (x1\ abs (x2\ pr x1 x2)))
  More [y] ? y
  No more solutions.

  WARNING: Because '_abstract' can abstract any logic variables, and
  because the underlying abstract machine of bedwyr is untyped, the
  abstraction produced by '_abstract' may not always respect the type
  of the constructor Lam. For example, consider the above example.  If
  pr is of type alpha -> beta -> gamma, for some distinct types alpha
  and beta, then the above query will still succeed despite the fact
  that abs is applied to terms of types alpha -> gamma and beta -> gamma.
  Hence type checking does not guarantee runtime type soundness
  ('well typed programs don't go wrong'). A solution to
  this would be to make the bedwyr engine aware of the type
  constraints, so that it only abstracts variables of the correct
  types.

- _cut : o -> o. Applying the predicate cut to a query removes the
  backtracking for that query. That is, a query such as (cut P) will
  produce the first solution (if any) to P, and terminates.

- _rigid : A -> o. This is a meta-level assertion predicate.
  (_rigid X) will throw an assertion (hence causes the prover to abort) if
  X is not a ground term.

- _eqvt : A -> A -> o. This predicate checks that its arguments are
  syntatically equivalent modulo renaming of nabla variables.

  For example,

  ?= nabla x\ nabla y\ _eqvt (f x y) (f y x).
  Yes.
  More [y] ? y
  No more solutions.
  ?= nabla x\ nabla y\ _eqvt (f x x) (f y y).
  Yes.
  More [y] ? y
  No more solutions.
  ?= nabla x\ nabla y\ _eqvt (f x x) (f x y).
  No.

- _abort: this predicate aborts the proof search and returns to the toplevel query (if in
  interactive mode).

- Printing facilities: I have added predicates to print to files.
  * fopen_out: string -> o.
    Open a file for writing.
  * fprint: string -> A -> o.
    Print to a file specified in the first argument. Fails if the file was not opened yet.
  * fclose_out: string -> o.

  Example:
  ?= fopen_out "test.txt".
  Yes.
  More [y] ? y
  No more solutions.
  ?= fprint "test.txt" "Test printing".
  Yes.
  More [y] ? y
  No more solutions.
  ?= fclose "test.txt".
  No definition found for fclose !
  ?= fclose_out "test.txt".
  Yes.
  More [y] ? y
  No more solutions.

  The file 'test.txt' will contain the string 'Test printing'.

II. Tabling

- Equivariant-tabling:
  I have modified the tabling mechanism to allow matching of a table
  entry modulo renaming of nabla variables. This mechanism is enabled
  by default, but can be turned on or off using the following command:

  #equivariant [on/off].


- Outputing entries of a table:
  I have added a facility to output the entries of a table:

  #save_table <predicate> <filename>:
  This will save the table for a predicate to a definition file. A
  proved entry will become the argument of a predicate called
  'proved'.  Similarly, an unproved entry will be the argument of an
  'unproved' predicate.

  In outputing an entry, the nabla variables (i.e., those of the forms
  (NB i) ) will be explicitly quantified with the nabla quantifier.
  If the equivariant tabling option is on, then we only quantify the
  nabla variables that are present in the entry.  If the equivariant
  tabling option is off, then we need to also explicitly include
  vacuous nabla's.  Currently, the tabling mechanism does not keep an
  explicit nabla-context (i.e., there is no explicit representation of
  a generic judgment; nabla-context is implicit), so what I've tried
  is to guess the number of nabla variables in the context by looking
  at the maximum index of the nabla variables in the entry. If the
  maximum index is n, then we produce n nabla quantifiers.

  For non-equivariant tabling, this use of maximum index may cause us
  to miss some vacuous nablas that appear inner most in a proved atomic
  goal.  For example, if a query like (nabla x\ nabla y\ p x)
  succeeds, then the table will only display (nabla x\ p x), because
  the vacuous y is forgotten in the table.  This behavior is strictly
  speaking unsound. For example, if p is defined as

   p X := sigma Y\ (X = Y => false).

  That is, p X is true if there exists a term distinct from X.
  Assuming that the types are vacuous, then (nabla x\ p x) is not
  provable in Linc, but (nabla x\ nabla y\ p x) is.  Suppose the
  latter were proved by Bedwyr (currently it's impossible because we
  can't yet handle logic variables on the left), then the table will
  instead display (nabla x\ p x) as provable, which is wrong.

  This unsoundness may never arise in the goals tabled by Bedwyr,
  because to produce this behavior, it seems that we need unification
  of logic variables on the left, which is not handled in Bedwyr
  anyway. But it'd be good if this can be fixed, if we want to be
  faithful to the Linc logic.

III. Parsing of types

  I have modified the parsing of types to allow polymorphic types.
  Type declarations can now contain variables, e.g.,

  #type cons (X -> list X -> list X).

  is now allowed. The free variables in the types will be abstracted.
  I introduce two additional constructors to help with recursion
  over type structures.
  Let's distinguish between a 'raw type' and a type. A raw type is
  any expression of the form (t1 -> t2 -> .. -> tn) parsed by bedwyr.
  A (object-level) type is formed from raw types using the constructor:

  ty : raw_type -> type.
  all : (raw_type -> type) -> type.

  So the above expression will be parsed into the following bedwyr term:

  all x\ ty (x -> list x -> list x).


IV. Bugs fixed.

- Implication left:
  An implication goal A => B can be seen as a conjunction

  /\ {B\theta | A\theta is provable}

  So the correct behavior of A => B should be one in which we
  accumulate all substitutions \theta for which A\theta is provable,
  and prove the big conjunction of /\ {B\theta}_\theta.

  For example, if A has two answer substitutions \theta and \sigma,
  then proving A => B is the same as proving (B\theta) /\ (B\sigma).
  In particular, if B contains logic variables, bindings to those
  logic variables that occur when proving (B\theta) should not be
  undone when moving to prove (B\sigma).

  For example, let p be defined as follows:

  p a.
  p b.

  and assume the standard 'member' predicate for list membership.
  Then the query (pi x\ p x => member x L) should produce an answer
  substitution as follows:

  ?= pi x\ p x => member x L.
  Solution found:
  L = (cons b (cons a H))

  What the previous implementation did was to undo the bindings to
  logic variables when moving from one instance of B\theta to another.


- #include directives:

  The #include directives, when parsing type declarations, did not
  load the include files properly.  This has now been fixed.  Multiple
  include's of the same file is treated as a single include.
