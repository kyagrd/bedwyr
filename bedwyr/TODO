* Experiments on static analyses: typing, and mode checking (which could allow
  to statically avoid logical variables on the left). This would probably
  be done thanks to the "parse" special predicate.

* Unification optimization for "fresh" variables: avoid occurs-check. Hopefully
  this could help a lot on the efficiency of type checking.

* Tail-rec zipper-based indexing, to make it more flexible,
 have get-and-set or be able to use it for definition lookup.

* Add a special predicate for inspecting the tables, consider tabling modulo
  (congruence|...).
