Implement static analyses: typing, and mode checking (which would allow to
statically avoid logical variables on the left).

Tail-rec zipper-based indexing, to make it more flexible,
have get-and-set or be able to use it for definition lookup.

Prove the many little optimizations, especially those related to tabling.
We avoid redundant successes, call failure instead of k directly.
