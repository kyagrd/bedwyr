* Experiments on static analyses (mode checking, which could allow
  to statically avoid logical variables on the left). This would probably
  be done in the Input module.

* Unification optimization for "fresh" variables: avoid occurs-check. Hopefully
  this could help a lot on the efficiency of type checking.
