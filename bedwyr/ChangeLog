1.4 (dev)
=========
  Bedwyr-with-round-tables
Fix:
  - crashes on duplicate or missing files
  - assertions not type-checked when not checked
  - assertions not checked in queries
  - incorrect tabled results within co-inductive loops
Changes:
  - port of the build system (bin and odoc) to ocamlbuild
  - zipper-based indexing with get-and-set functionality
  - #typeof outputs consistent type variables
  - more supported tokens
New:
  - simple theorems are used to improve tabling
    - forward chaining for filling (#saturation, --saturation)
    - backward chaining for accessing(#freezing, --freezing)
  - parametric polymorphism for constants and predicates
  - stdlib (only "list", "::", "nil" and "member")
  - *.deb and *-installer.exe generated by the Makefile
  - meaningful exit statuses
  - #show_def to peek in a predicate at run-time
  - stratification checking
  - better tabling via simple hypothesis support (eg "p 0 , p 1  |-  p 2")

1.3 (2012-02-29)
================
  Bedwyr-with-types
Fix:
  - 2 implication bugs : #13229 + timestamp problem (rev 740)
  - no more multiple input with multiple #include
Changes:
  - syntax closer to Abella's :
    - /\ for conjunction instead of ',' or &
    - \/ for disjunction instead of ';'
    - -> instead of =>
    - "forall X Y," instead of "pi X\ pi Y\"
    - "exists X Y," instead of "sigma X\ sigma Y\"
    - "nabla X Y," instead of "nabla X\ nabla Y\"
    - clauses grouped in definition blocks, only one block per predicate,
      no "inductive" and "coinductive" in the same block
    - type annotations for predicates and bound variables
    - Abella's keywords (e.g. Teyjus' keywords) forbidden
  - more names allowed (including names for infix constants)
  - C-style multiline nested comments
  - multiline quoted strings with escaped characters
  - parser less permissive: no more formula-as-term
  - more error output
  - ndcore in a distinct OCaml lib
  - updated userguide and README
New:
  - types
    - objects simply typed (no polymorphism, except for some predefined
      predicates like 'print')
    - input type-checked, declarations mandatory for types (except for nat,
      string and prop), constants and predicates (except for predefined
      predicates)
    - typing commands (#env, #typeof, but no more #type)
    - deprecated 'parse' predicate removed
  - equivariant tabling
  - I/O predefined predicates (print, fprint, etc)
  - undocumented experimental internal non-logical side-effecting
    predicates (_not, _abstract, _abort, etc)
  - table export (#save_table)
  - .deb and .ebuild publicly available

1.2 (2010-04-17)
================
Fix:
 - priority of conjunction and disjunction in the syntax
 - detect potential hole in unification when some left unifications
   make the level-based representation of raising inadequate
New:
 - underscore (_) is allowed for dummy logic variables
 - several new examples
 - pretty printing (indentation and better name generation)
 - slight extension of unification (simple case beyond llambda)

1.1 (2007-02-15)
================
Fix:
  - indexing
Changes:
  - handling of some error related to tabling
New:
  - some examples

1.0 (2006-11-01)
================
  Initial stable release (Bedwyr, the not-so-sound logician)
Features:
  - completed documentation
  - lots of examples
  - usability enhancements: session management, single-line comments
  - assertions for testing
  - new representation of nabla variables avoiding raising
  - major bugfixes in tabling
