.Sh DESCRIPTION
@PACKAGE_NAME@ is a theorem prover for the Level-0/1 fragment of the
Linc logic.
.Pp
It is based on
.An Tiu Ns 's
Level-0/1, and
.An Nadathur & Linell Ns 's
LLambda library. For background on the system, see
.Rs

.Pp
When invoked as
.Nm
the fastest available binary is used (i.e.
.Nm Ns Nm .native
if present; otherwise,
.Nm Ns Nm .byte ) .
.\"
.\"
.Sh OPTIONS
.Bl -tag -width Ic
.It Fl I
Do not enter interactive mode.
.It Fl t
Run tests in definition files.
Those are the queries given by
.Ic #assert Ar form Ns Ic \&.
(see
.Sx META-COMMANDS ) .
.It Fl \-strict
Quit at the first non-interactive error. If not set,
.Nm
won't exit on non-interactive errors (except for critical errors of status
.Ar 5 ,
see
.Sx EXIT STATUS )
but will exit at the end of the non-interactive stage
with the exit status of the first non-interactive error
(this is useful to typecheck a whole file at once).
.It Fl e Ar query
Execute
.Ar query
(see
.Sx TOPLEVEL QUERIES ) .
Such queries are executed in the order they are given on the command-line,
after all the input files a read but before entering the interactive loop.
.It Fl \-freezing Ar fp
Enable backward chaining and set its limit (the so-called
.Ar freezing-point )
to
.Ar fp .
Setting it to 0 (the default value) disables backward chaining,
setting it to \-1 allows for infinite chaining (usually not a smart idea).
The value 1 should be a good compromise.
.It Fl \-saturation Ar sp
Enable forward chaining and set its limit (the so-called
.Ar saturation-point )
to
.Ar sp .
Setting it to 0 (the default value) disables forward chaining,
setting it to \-1 allows infinite chaining and therefore actual saturation
of the table wrt the theorem.
.It Fl help , \-help
Display the version number and the list of command-line options.
.El
.\"
.\"
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Ex -std
.Bl -tag -width Ic
.It Ar 1
Input error (base syntax error, type error)
.It Ar 2
Definition error (wrong declaration, wrong definition or object misuse)
.It Ar 3
Core error (LLambda violation)
.It Ar 4
Solver error (Level 0/1 violation)
.It Ar 5
Generic error (failed assertion, undefined error)
.El
.\"
.\"
.Sh INPUT FILES
A definition file can contain any meta-command (see
.Sx META-COMMANDS ) ,
in addition to any of the following commands.
.\"
.Ss Type declaration
.Bl -tag -width Ic
.It Ic Kind Ar int,object Ic type.
This is the only kind of types allowed for now.
.Pp
The predefined types are
.Ar nat , string
and obviously
.Ar prop .
.El
.\"
.Ss Constant declaration
.Bl -tag -width Ic
.It Ic Type Ar z Ic int.
.It Ic Type Ar s Ic int \-> int.
.It Ic Type Ar min,max Ic (int \-> prop) \-> int.
No polymorphism is available yet, but all proper types
(even higher order ones) are allowed.
.Pp
Apart from
.Ar true
and
.Ar false ,
there are no actual predefined constants, but some runtime-defined constants:
.Ar 0 , 1 , ...
of type
.Ic nat ,
and any quoted string of type
.Ar string .
.El
.\"
.Ss Predicate declaration and definition
.Bl -tag -width Ic
.It Ic Definition Ao Ar declarations Ac Ns Ic \&.
.It Ic Definition Ao Ar declarations Ac Ic by Ao Ar definitions Ac Ns Ic \&.
The header of a definition block gives the declarations of the predicates
with mandatory type annotations ending with
.Ic prop
(for instance
.Ar p1 Ic \&: int \-> prop, Ar p2 Ic \&: prop ) .
.Pp
The body of a definition block gives discretionary clauses
for those predicates, and only those (for instance
.Ar p1 (s (s N)) := p1 N Ic \&; Ar p2 Ic \&; Ar p1 z ) .
Here,
.Ar p1
is true on all even church integers and
.Ar p2
is equal to
.Ar true .
.Pp
The head of a bodyless clause is always true.
A predicate without any clauses is always false.
.El
.\"
.Ss Theorems
.Bl -tag -width Ic
.It Ic Theorem Ar thm Ic \&: Ar forall Y, body X Y \-> head X Ns Ic \&.
A theorem is a valid Abella theorem with some restrictions on its body
(neither implication nor universal quantification).
.El
.\"
.\"
.Sh TOPLEVEL QUERIES
.Bl -tag -width Ic
.It Ic ?= Ar query Ns Ic \&.
The query entered at the prompt can either be a meta-command,
which is executed, or a formula, which is solved (meaning that
.Nm
searches for all substitutions of free variables satisfying
.Ar query
and offers to display them one by one).
.It Nm Fl e Qo Ar query Qc Ns Ic \&.
Queries given via this option are dealt with in the exact same way.
.El
.\"
.\"
.Sh META-COMMANDS
Those can be given both in a file and to the toplevel.
.Bl -tag -width Ic
.It Ic #help.
This command should give a starting point.
.It Ic #exit.
And this one, an ending point.
.El
.\"
.\"
.Sh OUTPUT
The only non-interactive output is given by
.Ic #save_table Ar pred Qo Ar newfile.def Qc Ns Ic \&. .
.\"
.\"
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width Ic
.It Pa +pkgdatadir+/examples/
Sample input files.
Most of them have assertions that can be checked with the command-line option
.Fl t .
