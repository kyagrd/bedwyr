The directory does some comparisons between fixed sized stacks and
fixed sized queues.  Clearly, these are not bisimilar.  The main idea
is to test how long it takes to determine this non-bisimilarity.

The results are reported in the files time.bc-* (for early bisimulation)
and time.lbc-* (for late bisimulation).  Those files were generated on an
average 2013 laptop.  For example, those are the times of the native
1.4 version of bedwyr:

10:stack:12 queue:12 nbisim:5
20:stack:31 queue:31 nbisim:13
30:stack:65 queue:67 nbisim:27
40:stack:127 queue:129 nbisim:52
50:stack:217 queue:227 nbisim:91
60:stack:339 queue:373 nbisim:141
70:stack:514 queue:564 nbisim:217
80:stack:746 queue:828 nbisim:313

Thus, it took 746 milliseconds to determine that a stack of 80
elements is bisimilar to itself; 828 milliseconds to check a queue of
80 elements is bisimilar to itself; and 313 milliseconds to notice that
a stack and queue on 80 elements are different.

$(make test) uses the files gensq.c and sq to help automate the process
of generating these values.
