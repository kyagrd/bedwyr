The directory does some comparisons between fixed sized stacks and
fixed sized queues.  Clearly, these are not bisimilar.  The main idea
is to test how long it takes to determine this non-bisimilarity.

The results are reported in the files time.bc (for early bisimulation)
and time.lbc (for late bisimulation).  For example, the file time.lbc
was generated by an average office workstation.

10:stack:226 queue:255 nbisim:34
20:stack:1271 queue:1564 nbisim:116
30:stack:5256 queue:6728 nbisim:360
40:stack:16451 queue:21400 nbisim:851
50:stack:44714 queue:58436 nbisim:1846
60:stack:91260 queue:117804 nbisim:2967
70:stack:167642 queue:220630 nbisim:4689
80:stack:301549 queue:393940 nbisim:7441

Thus, it took 226 milliseconds to determine that a stack of 10
elements is bisimilar to itself; 225 milliseconds to check a queue of
10 elements is bisimilar to itself; and 34 milliseconds to notice that
a stack and queue on 10 elements are different.

The files autorun, gensq.c, and sq are used to help automate the
process of generating these values.
