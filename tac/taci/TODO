A few things that would be useful...

* [David] Better syntax for higher-order terms
  Currently, (x\y\ ..) is not allowed, only (x\(y\ ..)).
* [Zach] Monotonicity checking.
* Type checking.
* Generate "simple" invariants from the context.
  In a second time, generate the most general set of equalities describing
  the relationship between parameters. E.g., for the coinductive proof of
  (sim p p) then invariant is (p\q\ p=q). Sometimes, generalizing by relaxing
  an equality might be needed to complete the proof. I don't know if that is to
  be considered here.
* Tactic for instantiating logic variables.
* Displaying the generic context would be much more comfortable.
* Support for anonymous fixed points.
