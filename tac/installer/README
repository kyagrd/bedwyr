Tac::Installer

===============================================================================

Requirements:
  To create the Windows installer you must have NSIS installed.  It is available
  at http://nsis.sourceforge.net/.

  Also, we really need a new logo, but I'm no graphic designer, and this is
  more like a request than a requirement.

Building the Installer:
  First, verify that the required software is installed.
  
  Next, build the system using Microsoft Visual Studio 2008; for information
  on building the system see "/tac/INSTALL".

  Finally, right-click on "/tac/installer/tac.nsi" and select "Compile NSIS Script".
