Tac::Building and Installing the Tac system

===============================================================================

Note on StickyTaci and Stekki:
  StickyTaci and Stekki are graphical interfaces to taci.  Unfortunately,
  StickyTaci currently only works on Windows (XP and higher), and Stekki can't
  work on Windows.  See "/tac/StickyTaci/README" and "/tac/stekki/README" for
  more information.  If you want to compile StickyTaci with Mono, see
  "/tac/StickyTaci/INSTALL".

Building Tac on Linux:
  Dependencies:
    O'Caml
    Labltk (for Stekki)

  The build system is still pretty rudimentary but should work on a standard
  installation of OCaml. If it does not, please edit the corresponding
  Makefile to adapt them -- they are fairly simple.

  Compiling:
    To build taci and Stekki, simply run make from the corresponding
    subdirectories, or simply from toplevel as follows:
      $ make taci
      $ make stekki

  Building tactex requires that xml-light (available at
  http://www.motion-twin.com) be installed in your OCAML_LIBS/xml-light.
  To do it just run:
      $ make tools

Building Tac on Windows XP:
  The easiest way is to build Tac on Windows XP is using Microsoft Visual
  Studio 2005 along with the included solution "/tac/tac.sln".

  For information about building the installer, see "/tac/installer/README".
  
  Dependencies:
    Microsoft Visual Studio 2008    http://www.microsoft.com/express
    O'Caml                          http://caml.inria.fr
    Ocamake                         http://tech.motion-twin.com
    Xml-Light                       http://tech.motion-twin.com

  Compiling:
    First you must compile Ocamake and put it on your path.  The easiest
    way to do this is to compile it as follows:

      ocamlc unix.cma str.cma ocamake.ml -o ocamake.exe

    Then, place the generated executable in your path.  If you have already
    installed O'Caml, a reasonable place to copy the generated executable
    is in the O'Caml /bin directory.

    Next, be sure that Xml-Light is installed somewhere that O'Caml can find
    it.

    Next, simply open the provided solution and build it (Ctrl + Alt + F7).
    All components that can be built (namely, taci, logics_gen, StickyTaci,
    ndcore, and tactex) will be built in the proper order. The resulting
    executables will be copied to the directory "/tac/bin".

    Note: Ocamake doesn't worry about 'inconsistency' violations when
    determining what to recompile.  Therefore sometimes when building Tac
    in Microsoft Visual Studio 2008 you will get an error from O'Caml
    complaining that it can't link.  If this occurs just run the script
    "/tac/taci/clean.bat" (and possibly the "/tac/logics_gen/clean.bat")
    and recompile.
