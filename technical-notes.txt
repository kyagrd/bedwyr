Some technical notes
====================
Alwen Tiu, 02 September 2011.

These notes are to give an overview of the modifications I made to a
branch of Bedwyr that I created in the process of implementing the
bisimulation checker SPEC.  This should be viewed as a temporary
documentation to facilitate the merging of this branch into the main
trunk of Bedwyr. It should be eventually integrated into the existing
documentation structure for the project.

II. Tabling

- Equivariant-tabling:
  I have modified the tabling mechanism to allow matching of a table
  entry modulo renaming of nabla variables. This mechanism is enabled
  by default, but can be turned on or off using the following command:

  #equivariant [on/off].


- Outputing entries of a table:
  I have added a facility to output the entries of a table:

  #save_table <predicate> <filename>:
  This will save the table for a predicate to a definition file. A
  proved entry will become the argument of a predicate called
  'proved'.  Similarly, an unproved entry will be the argument of an
  'unproved' predicate.

  In outputing an entry, the nabla variables (i.e., those of the forms
  (NB i) ) will be explicitly quantified with the nabla quantifier.
  If the equivariant tabling option is on, then we only quantify the
  nabla variables that are present in the entry.  If the equivariant
  tabling option is off, then we need to also explicitly include
  vacuous nabla's.  Currently, the tabling mechanism does not keep an
  explicit nabla-context (i.e., there is no explicit representation of
  a generic judgment; nabla-context is implicit), so what I've tried
  is to guess the number of nabla variables in the context by looking
  at the maximum index of the nabla variables in the entry. If the
  maximum index is n, then we produce n nabla quantifiers.

  For non-equivariant tabling, this use of maximum index may cause us
  to miss some vacuous nablas that appear inner most in a proved atomic
  goal.  For example, if a query like (nabla x\ nabla y\ p x)
  succeeds, then the table will only display (nabla x\ p x), because
  the vacuous y is forgotten in the table.  This behavior is strictly
  speaking unsound. For example, if p is defined as

   p X := sigma Y\ (X = Y => false).

  That is, p X is true if there exists a term distinct from X.
  Assuming that the types are vacuous, then (nabla x\ p x) is not
  provable in Linc, but (nabla x\ nabla y\ p x) is.  Suppose the
  latter were proved by Bedwyr (currently it's impossible because we
  can't yet handle logic variables on the left), then the table will
  instead display (nabla x\ p x) as provable, which is wrong.

  This unsoundness may never arise in the goals tabled by Bedwyr,
  because to produce this behavior, it seems that we need unification
  of logic variables on the left, which is not handled in Bedwyr
  anyway. But it'd be good if this can be fixed, if we want to be
  faithful to the Linc logic.
