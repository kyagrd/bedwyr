The Whisky Problem
------------------

------
Summary:
Needs some sort of Generalisation
------

------
Definitions:

p(0, 0)
p(X, 0) -> p(h(X), 0)
p(h(X), Y) -> p(X, s(Y))

------

Theorem:
forall y. p(0, y)

------
Comments:

This is a proof from the domain of first order temporal logic.

For it to go through the original conjecture needs to be 
generalised to:

forall y, n. p(h^n(0), y) (where h^n means n applications of h - which is
second order)

or 

a new function h* needs to be introduced

h*(0, X) = X
h*(s(n), X) = h(h*(n, X))

and the conjecture generalised to

forall y, n. p(h*(n, 0), y)
