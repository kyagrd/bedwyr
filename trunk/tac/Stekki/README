===============================================================================

Stekki is a graphical user interface to the taci command line tool. It is
written in O'Caml using Labeltk.  It runs only in Linux; the way in which
it makes use of the O'Caml Unix module precludes its use on Windows.
Specifcally, it uses 'select' on a file descriptor; this functionality is not
available in Windows.

Stekki runs on a (possibly unexistent) file, whose extension specifies which 
logic to use. By default muLJ is used.

Usage:  
  $ Stekki/stekki examples/arithmetic.muLJ.tac

Using Stekki:
  Using Alt-Down and Alt-Up you can do/undo a command from the file.
  The command then moves in a locked area where you can't edit it.
  You must undo it before editing the command.
  
  The Load and Save button reload and save the file. In both cases, it also 
  undoes all inputs and resets taci.
  
  The Interrupt button sends Ctrl+C to to taci; this can be used to kill a long
  running tactical application without losing your place in the current proof.
 
 Known Issues and Bugs:
  Stekki can get confused if you have multiline strings that contain
  periods.  As long as you don't use multiline strings with periods, this
  shouldn't happen, and such lines shouldn't ever occur (because periods are
  not part of any of the logics' syntax) in general.  But, be wary!
  
  Rarely undo breaks and you lose synchronization between the interface and 
  taci in other cases, as well.  You can then use the Reset button to start
  over.
