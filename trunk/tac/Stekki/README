===============================================================================

Stekki is a graphical user interface to the taci command line tool. It is
written in O'Caml using Labeltk.  It runs only in Linux; the way in which
it makes use of the O'Caml Unix module precludes its use on Windows.  Specifcally,
it uses 'select' on a file descriptor; this functionality is not available
in Windows.

Stekki runs on a (possibly unexistent) file, whose extension specifies the 
logic to use. By default muLJ is used.

Usage:  
  tac $ Stekki/stekki examples/arithmetic.muLJ.tac

Using Stekki:
  Using Alt-Down and Alt-Up you can do/undo a command from the file. The command 
  then moves in a blocked area where you can't edit it. You should undo it before 
  editing.
  
  Rarely undo breaks and you lose synchronization between the interface and 
  taci. You can then use the Reset button.
  
  The Load and Save button reload and save the file. In both cases, it also 
  undoes all inputs and resets taci.
  
  The Interrupt button sends Ctrl+C to to taci; this can be used to kill a long
  running tactical application without losing your place in the current proof.
