Tac::Building and Installing the Tac system

===============================================================================

Note on StickyTaci and Stekki:
  StickyTaci and Stekki are graphical interfaces to taci.  Unfortunately,
  StickyTaci currently only works on Windows (XP and higher), and stekki can't
  work on Windows.  See "/tac/StickyTaci/README" and "/tac/stekki/README" for
  more information.  If you want to compile StickyTaci with Mono, see
  "/tac/StickyTaci/INSTALL".

Building Tac on Linux:
  Dependencies:
    O'Caml
    Labltk

  Compiling:
    You first have to make sure that the ndcore library inside Bedwyr
    is compiled:
  
      tac $ make -C ../bedwyr
    
    Then you can build taci and Stekki:
      
      tac $ make -C taci
      tac $ make -C Stekki

    Building tactex requires that xml-light (available at
    http://www.motion-twin.com) be installed somewhere that O'Caml can
    find it.

      tac $ make -C tools

Building Tac on Windows XP:
  The easiest way is to build Tac on Windows XP is using Microsoft Visual
  Studio 2005 along with the included solution "tac/tac.sln".

  Dependencies:
    Microsoft Visual Studio 2008    http://www.microsoft.com/express
    O'Caml                          http://caml.inria.fr
    Ocamake*                        http://tech.motion-twin.com
    Xml-Light                       http://tech.motion-twin.com

    * Use the included ocamake.ml, as it has been patched to work with
      Microsoft Visual 2008 project files.

  Compiling:
    First you must compile Ocamake and put it on your path.  The easiest
    way to do this is to compile it as follows:

      ocamlc unix.cma str.cma ocamake.ml -o ocamake.exe

    Then, place the generated executable in your path.  If you have already
    installed O'Caml, a reasonable place to copy the generated executable
    is in the O'Caml /bin directory.

    Next, be sure that Xml-Light is installed somewhere that O'Caml can find
    it.

    Next, simply open the provided solution and build it (Ctrl + Alt + F7).
    All components that can be built (namely, taci, logics_gen, StickyTaci,
    ndcore, and tactex) will be built in the proper order. The resulting
    executables will be copied to the directory "/tac/bin".
