This is an experimental proof viewer based on HTML, Javascript, and
JQuery. It reads Tac proofs as xml files and renders them into proof
trees which can be dynamically expanded and explored.


Notes
=====

  These files must be hosted on a webserver. Offline viewing does not
  work due to the way JQuery uses HTTP requests to retrive the xml
  files.


TODO
====

  - Handle generic and global contexts
  - Handle freezing and focus annotations
  - Compress async phases
  - Fix compatibility issues
