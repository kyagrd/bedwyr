Tactex:

  Usage:
    tactex --input "input.xml" --output "output.tex"
    tactex --input "input.xml" --output "outline.tex" --outline

  The program converts a proof (*.xml) to LaTeX.  To convert the resulting file
  to *.dvi, use:
  
    $ latex <file.tex>

  The resulting DVI file can be turned into a PS with an adjusted bounding box
  by using:

    $ dvips -E <file.dvi> -o <file.ps>

  Or, to convert it to *.pdf, use:
  
    $ pdflatex <file.tex>

  The "--outline" option produces a proof 'sketch' or outline that is simpler
  than the original proof.  This outline essentially only shows rules done
  in the synchronous phase, as well as the final sequent of the asynchronous
  phase; it folds all asynchronous rules into a single inference rule named
  'async'.  Also, the 'active' formula for each rule is highlighted in blue.

  Currently tactex can generate very large *.tex files which TeX can sometimes
  choke on.  Even if TeX doesn't choke, sometimes the proof styler doesn't work
  quite right.

All-in-one "view" script:

  Under UNIX the script view bundles all steps, including viewing using gv.
  Usage:
    view <file.xml>
    view <file.xml> [--outline]
