Outliner:
  This program takes a proof (*.xml) on stdin and produces a proof 'sketch' or
  outline that is simpler than the original on stdout.  This outline essentially
  only shows rules done in the synchronous phase, as well as the final sequent in
  the asynchronous phase.

  Usage:
    outliner < "input.xml" > "output.xml"

Tactex:
  The program converts a proof (*.xml) to LaTeX.  To convert the resulting file
  to *.dvi, use:
  
    $ latex <file.tex>
  
  Or, to convert it to *.pdf, use:
  
    $ pdflatex <file.tex>
 
  Currently tactex can generate very large *.tex files which TeX can sometimes
  choke on.
 
  Usage:
    tactex --input "input.xml" --output "output.tex"
