Tactex:
  The program converts a proof (*.xml) to LaTeX.  To convert the resulting file
  to *.dvi, use:
  
    $ latex <file.tex>
  
  Or, to convert it to *.pdf, use:
  
    $ pdflatex <file.tex>

  The "--outline" option produces a proof 'sketch' or outline that is simpler than
  the original proof.  This outline essentially only shows rules done in the
  synchronous phase, as well as the final sequent in the asynchronous phase.

  Currently tactex can generate very large *.tex files which TeX can sometimes
  choke on.

  Usage:
    tactex --input "input.xml" --output "output.tex"
    tactex --input "input.xml" --output "outline.tex" --outline
