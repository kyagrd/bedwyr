Tac::StickyTaci::Building and Installing StickyTaci Dependencies

===============================================================================

Building and installing StickyTaci on Windows should be really easy; just
open the solution ("/tac/tac.sln") and build all.  But, that means you will
be using the provided, precompiled dynamic libraries for Scintilla and
Scintilla.NET ("/tac/bin/SciLexer.dll" and "/tac/bin/ScintillaNET.dll",
respectively).  You may want to compile these yourself, for instance if you
want to try to compile StickyTaci with Mono and run it under Linux (honestly,
you should try Wine first).  At any rate, it won't be fun, but it should be
possible.

Rebuilding Scintilla with LexSimple.cxx:
  First, download Scintilla's source and compile it, and make sure it works
  correctly; let's call the root directory of your Scintilla install
  /scintilla.
  
  Next, copy /tac/StickyTaci/LexSimple.cxx into the /scintilla/src/, and run
  the python script /scintilla/src/LexGen.py.

  Next, you'll need to add the following  definitions to the interface file
  (/scintilla/include/Scintilla.iface).  It should be easy to see where,
  just look at the code for python (search for SCE_PYTHON in the interface file):
    SCE_SIMPLE
    SCE_SIMPLE_DEFAULT
    SCE_SIMPLE_STRING
    SCE_SIMPLE_NUMBER
    SCE_SIMPLE_OPERATOR
    SCE_SIMPLE_IDENTIFIER
    SCE_SIMPLE_COMMENTLINE
    SCE_SIMPLE_OLDLINE

  Then, you'll need to regenerate the interface using HFace.py and/or Face.py,
  and finally recompile Scintilla.  Then, copy the binary (SciLexer.dll) to
  /tac/StickyTaci/.  And that's it for Scintilla.

Rebuilding Scintilla.NET:
  This part is a bit worse.  The problem is that Scintilla.NET seems to have
  'hardcoded' a lot of things when it comes to managing 'configurations'.  Again,
  let's call the Scintilla.NET directory /ScintillaNET.
  
  First, you'll need to open the solution for Scintilla.NET and add some
  files to /ScintillaNET/source/Configuration/Builtin, specifically
  /LexerKeywordListNames/simple.txt and /LexerStyleNames/simple.txt.  Use
  /tac/StickyTaci/simple_keywords.txt for the former, and
  /tac/StickyTaci/simple_style.txt for the latter.  Be sure that you mark
  these files to be embedded in the generated binary!
  
  This *should* be enough, but you might have to tweak some other stuff; sorry!
  If it is enough, you can just recompile Scintilla.NET and copy the binary
  (ScintillaNET.dll) to /tac/StickyTaci/.  And that's it for ScintillaNET.

If everthing goes smoothly you can just rebuild StickyTaci and away you go.
If you have any luck compiling and running StickyTaci on a non-Windows OS, let
us know!
