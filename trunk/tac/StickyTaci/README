StickyTaci is a graphical user interface to the taci command line
tool.  It is written in C# 2.0 using Windows Forms.  It has only been
test on Windows XP.  It communicates with taci via pipes.

Running StickyTaci:
  To start StickyTaci simply double-click the executable, found at
  "tac/bin/StickyTaci.exe".  This starts both StickyTaci and taci.  The
  taci window may be minimized if this is desired; it sometimes is placed
  above the StickyTaci window.

Getting Started with StickyTaci:
  After starting StickyTaci the first thing to do is to either select the
  logic in which you would like to work, or to open a new file.  If you
  are starting from scratch you will select the logic in which you would
  like to reason from the Tac/Logics menu.  If you would like to open a
  saved StickyTaci session (*.tac) you may do so using the File/Open menu
  item.  Opening a StickyTaci session automatically loads the correct
  logic based on the session's filename.

  At this point you may enter any definitions or theorems that one would
  like in the main window.  To execute the lines in the main window one
  uses the various navigation commands, all available in the Tac menu
  (see Interacting with Taci).

  
Syntax Highlighting:
  StickyTaci provides a very simple (and broken) syntax highlighter.  The
  highlighter works on a line-by-line basis, highlighting commands in red,
  tacticals in blue, comments in green, quoted strings in marroon, and
  already executed lines in gray.  Unfortunately, it doesn't highlight
  quoted strings quite right, which means quoted strings that span multiple
  lines do not show up as they should.  

Interacting with Taci:
  The Tac menu in StickyTaci offers a number of ways to interact with
  Taci.


  Navigation:
    The navigation section of the Tac menu provides a number of ways to
    execute the lines in the main window. Execution of Tac commands and
    tacticals is based on the active line. The active line is indicated by a
    green circle at the left of the line.

    To execute the active line use the Tac/Next Line menu item or the
    Ctrl + Alt + Down hotkey.  This will execute the active line and
    move the active line down one line.

    To undo to the previous line use the Tac/Previous Line menu item or
    the Ctrl + Alt + Up hotkey.  This will undo the last line and move
    active line up one line.

    To run all lines starting from the currently active line use the
    Tac/End menu item or the Ctrl + Alt + PageDown hotkey.

    To return to the top of the window use the Tac/Start menu item or 
    the Ctrl + Alt + PageUp hotkey.  This resets Taci and sets the active
    line to the first line in the file.

  The Taci/Logics menu offers a list of logics with which Taci can reason.
  You may switch to any of these logics at any time by selecting one of
  the logics in the list.  Note, however, that switching logics sets the
  active line to 0 and resets Taci.

  The Taci/Tacticals menu offers a list of all of the tacticals that the
  current logics provides.  Selecting a tactical adds it to the currently
  open file at the cursors location.
