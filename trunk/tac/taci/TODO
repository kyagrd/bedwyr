TODO:
  * The 'a polarized type in firstorderabsyn.ml could get factored out by
    pushing the annotation into relevant types.

  * The abstractions corresponding to a pi/sigma/nabla are different than lambda
    abstractions at the heads of invariants or definitions, and the types should
    reflect this.

  * Putting polarity annotations everywhere may allow funny games (like a 
    positive implication) but I really don't see why the application should be 
    polarized -- which caused bugs, and might cause more.

  * Output modules shouldn't take strings but formatters, in order to allow
    thinks like: O.debug "%s: invalid level %d" bla bli

  * [David] Better syntax for higher-order terms
    Currently, (x\y\ ..) is not allowed, only (x\(y\ ..)).
  
  * Type checking.
  
  * Support for anonymous fixed points.
