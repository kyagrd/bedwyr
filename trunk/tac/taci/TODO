A few things that would be useful...

* [David] Better syntax for higher-order terms
  Currently, (x\y\ ..) is not allowed, only (x\(y\ ..)).

* [Zach] Monotonicity checking.

* Type checking.

* Generate "simple" invariants from the context.
  After that, generate the most general set of equalities describing
  the relationship between parameters. E.g., for the coinductive proof of
  (sim p p) then invariant is (p\q\ p=q). Sometimes, generalizing by relaxing
  an equality might be needed to complete the proof. I don't know if that is to
  be considered here.

* Generate an invariant from the body of a definition to ease justification
  of unfolding a mu on the left/nu on the right.

* Tactic for instantiating logic variables.

* Displaying the generic context would be much more comfortable.

* Support for anonymous fixed points.
