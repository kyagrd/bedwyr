# Bedwyr 1.1 the not-so-sound-logician #
========================================

This is Bedwyr, a theorem prover for the Level-0/1 fragment of the Linc logic.
This is free software, licensed under GPL version 2.

Webpage: http://slimmer.gforge.inria.fr/bedwyr

Bedwyr is based on Alwen Tiu's Level-0/1, and Nadathur & Linell's LLambda
library, both written in SML. The OCaml translation has been done by
Baelde & Ziegler. It is currently under work by Baelde & Gacek.
The system also benefited from the wisdom of Miller, Nadathur and Pientka.

For background on the system, see "Mixing Finite Success and Finite Failure
in an Automated Prover" (Alwen Tiu and Gopalan Nadathur and Dale Miller):

Building the system:
# ./configure
# make
# src/bedwyr

Type "#help." in Bedwyr for a little help.
See doc/userguide.(ps.gz|pdf) for more information on how to use it.

Structure of the distribution:
/examples
  A few simple examples.
/src
  Source code for the prover.
/src/ndcore
  Code for the unification and non-destructive normalization of LLambda.
  Also contains a term indexing module, currenlty only used for tabling.
  This comes with oUnit and Test for testing it.
