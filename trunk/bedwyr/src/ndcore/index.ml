(** In this file we implement an index structure used for tabling.
  * An index represents a set of terms, in which eigenvariables may be allowed
  * but not logic variable -- since this requires suspensions.
  * The terms are abstracted over their eigenvars in the set.
  * For efficiency, the index lookup first parses the "rigid" structure of a
  * term in linear time, and extracts variables, and then takes care of the
  * equalities among these variables.
  * Currently the Nabla indices are handled as part of the rigid structure of
  * terms, which means that weakening and swapping are not supported.
  * Later, the set of nabla variables could be extracted and simplified to an
  * essential representation just like eigenvariables. *)

(** {1 Constraint management}
  * In the tree, variables are identified by uniques numbers, which I'll call
  * the VID (variable id). We could get rid of that and rely only on the order
  * in which we meet the vars in the tree, but that would involve extra
  * care when changing an algorithm (insertion/lookup or fold).
  * So at the end of a branch we have a collection of variables with VIDs,
  * and we want to store a constraint describing this collection, such that
  * two formulas satisfying the same rigid structure and map are indeed
  * logically equivalent.
  * We first get rid of VIDs, which are not necessarily [0,1,2..n], and renumber
  * variables using CIDs (constraint id) from 0 to n. In the constraint we
  * store:
  * - the maximum VID
  * - an array mapping CID to VID
  * - an array describing variable equalities: to each variable (denoted by its
  *   CID) is associated the smallest (in term of CID) equal variable.
  * - the array mapping CIDs to local timestamps. *)
