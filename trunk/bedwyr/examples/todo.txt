Examples (and counterexample) that we might write in Bedwyr

I (Dale) list a few topics quickly that we might consider putting into
the example repository.  

Pi-calculus
  We already have some files for this, but we should develop this into
  a larger collection of examples.  Including oben bisimulation,
  traces, trace equivalence, structural equivalence (without !),
  modals (Hennessy-Milner logic (as in Alwen's CONCUR2006 paper)) and 
  spacial logic kinds of examples.

  Catuscia sent the following link about a project on checking open
  bisimilarity http://www.cs.auc.dk/research/FS/ny/PR-pi/ 

Divergence and applicative bisimulation examples
  see paper by Alberto and Alwen for examples.  These are mostly
  co-inductive.  I'm guessing that cyclic checking will work rarely,
  but still it will illustrate teh spirit of the logic.

Spacial logic
  for structured data
