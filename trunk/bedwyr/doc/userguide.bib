  ABSTRACT = {Higher-order patterns (HOPs) are a class of
                  lambda-terms which behave almost like first-order
                  terms w.r.t. unification: unification is decidable
                  and unifiable terms have most general unifiers which
                  are easy to compute. HOPs were first discovered by
                  Dale Miller and subsequently developed and applied
                  by Pfenning and Nipkow. This paper presents a
                  stepwise development of a functional unification
                  algorithm for HOPs. Both the usual representation of
                  lambda-terms with alphabetic bound variables and de
                  Bruijn's notation are treated. The appendix contains
                  a complete listing of an implementation in Standard
                  ML.}

  ABSTRACT = {This paper discusses two rules of definitional
                  reflection: The "logical" version of definitional
                  reflection as used in the extended logic programming
                  language GCLA and the "$\omega$"-version of
                  definitional reflection as proposed by Eriksson and
                  Girard. The logical version is a Left-introduction
                  rule completely analogous to the Left-introduction
                  rules for logical operators in Gentzen-style sequent
                  systems, whereas the $\omega$-version extends the
                  logical version by a principle related to the
                  $\omega$-rule in arithmetic. Correspondingly, the
                  interpretation of free variables differs between the
                  two approaches, resulting in different principles of
                  closure of inference rules under substitution. This
                  difference is crucial for the computational
                  interpretation of definitional reflection.}
